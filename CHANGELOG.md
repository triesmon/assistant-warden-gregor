# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Auto-start scheduled events at their start time, opt-in per guild via `/gregor-admin` toggle.
  - Pure `findEventsToAutoStart` scheduler function with full unit test coverage.
  - `startEvent` handles Discord API errors gracefully (deleted events, missing permissions).
  - Per-call try/catch isolation so one failing start never blocks alerts or other auto-starts.

## [0.1.0] — 2025-07-10

### Added

- Initial Gregor bot: scheduled event DM reminders before events start.
- `/gregor-admin` slash command for server admins to configure alerts.
- `/subscribe` slash command for members to manage personal alert subscriptions.

- Components v2 UI panels for alert configuration and sent history browsing.
- Alert deduplication via `(guild, event, alert)` unique sent-history tracking.
- Docker Compose setup and smoke test suite.
